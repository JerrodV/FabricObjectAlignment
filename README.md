# Fabric Object Alignment
An object (possibly plugin) that will allow you to align one fabric canvas object to another.

The recent commits have the process up and running with toggleable settings and even some feedback from what the object is doing.

There are a few glitches I need to look into. I will be creating issues for those, so feel free to jump over there and take a look.

Thanks for your interest.
