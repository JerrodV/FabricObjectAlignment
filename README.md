# Fabric Object Alignment
An object (possibly plugin) that will allow you to align one fabric canvas object to another.
I have a more refined object in production. The result is just an embelishment of what I started in this fiddle: https://github.com/JerrodV/FabricObjectAlignment
I have all aspects working and toggleable in other code. It is just a bit of math, and keystrokes, and perfectly free.
It will just take a bit for me to extract that code from a project and present it here in a usable fasion. 
Then we can talk about the potential for a supportable fabric plugin.
